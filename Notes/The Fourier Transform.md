he Fourier transform is one of those rare [[algorithm]]: brilliant, elegant, and with a million use cases. he best analogy for the Fourier transform comes from Better Explained a great website that explains math simply): given a smoothie, the Fourier transform will tell you the ingredients in the smoothie.1 Or, to put it another way, given a song, the transform can separate it into individual frequencies. It turns out that this simple idea has a lot of use cases. For example, if you can separate a song into frequencies, you can boost the ones you care about. You could boost the bass and hide the treble. he Fourier transform is great for processing signals. You can also use it to compress music. First you break an audio ile down into its ingredient notes. he Fourier transform tells you exactly how much each note contributes to the overall song. So you can just get rid of the notes that aren’t important. hat’s how the MP3 format works! Music isn’t the only type of digital signal. he JPG format is another compressed format, and it works the same way. People use the Fourier transform to try to predict upcoming earthquakes and analyze DNA.
