linear programming is a technique that helps us to find the optimum solution for a given problem, an optimum solution is that solution that is the best possible outcome of a given particular problem. In simple terms, it is the method to find out how to do something in the best possible way in given limited resources you need to do the optimum utilization of resources to achieve the best possible result in a particular objective. such as least cost, highest margin, or least time on those resources have alternate uses The situation which requires a search for best values of the variables subject to certain constraints are amendable programming analysis. These situations cannot be handled by the usual tools of Calculus or marginal analysis. The calculus technique can only handle exactly equal constraints while this limitation does not exist in the case of linear programming problems. A linear programming problem has two basic parts:

-   **First Part:** It is the objective function that describes the primary purpose of the formation to maximize some return or to minimize some.
-   **Second Part:** It is a constant set, It is the system of equalities or inequalities which describe the condition or constraints of the restriction under which Optimisation is to be accomplished.

### **Types of Linear Programming Problems**

Basically, there are many different linear programming problems but we will deal with three major linear programming problems in this article.

1.  **Manufacturing Problems:** Manufacturing problems are the problem which deals with the number of unit that should be produced or sold in order to maximize profits when each product requires fixed manpower, machine hours, and raw materials.
2.  **Diet Problems:** It is used to calculate the amount to different kinds of constituents to be included in the diet in order to get the minimizing of cost and subject to the availability of food and their prices.
3.  **Transportation Problems:** It is used to determine the transportation schedule to find the cheapest way of transporting a product from plants /factories situated at different locations to different markets.

### **Terms Related to Linear Programming Problems**

In order to solve linear programming problems you need to be clear your concept about the basic terminologies used in solving the first linear programming problems are given below:

-   **Decision Variable:** Variables that compete with each other to share limited resources such as product services etc. They are interrelated and have a linear relationship which is capable of deciding what is the best optimum solution are called decision variable.
-   **Objective Function**: The problem must have been a clear and well-defined objective that can be stated quantitatively such as maximization of profit or minimization of cost etc this all example fall under the category of the objective function.
-   **Constraints:** These are the restrictions imposed on the resources available such as a restricted number of machines, labor material, etc.
-   **Redundant Constraint:** Some constraints are visibly present but do not hinder the process of the problem under study is called a redundant constraint.
-   **Feasible Solution:** These are the set of all possible solutions in the form of variables that satisfy the constants.
-   **Optimum Solution:** This is the best solution among all of the possible one that supports the objective of the problem in the best manner.
