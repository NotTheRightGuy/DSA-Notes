A **parallel algorithm** is an algorithm that can execute several instructions simultaneously on different processing devices and then combine all the individual outputs to produce the final result.

## Concurrent Processing

The easy availability of computers along with the growth of Internet has changed the way we store and process data. We are living in a day and age where data is available in abundance. Every day we deal with huge volumes of data that require complex computing and that too, in quick time. Sometimes, we need to fetch data from similar or interrelated events that occur simultaneously. This is where we require **concurrent processing** that can divide a complex task and process it multiple systems to produce the output in quick time.

Concurrent processing is essential where the task involves processing a huge bulk of complex data. Examples include − accessing large databases, aircraft testing, astronomical calculations, atomic and nuclear physics, biomedical analysis, economic planning, image processing, robotics, weather forecasting, web-based services, etc.

## What is Parallelism?

**Parallelism** is the process of processing several set of instructions simultaneously. It reduces the total computational time. Parallelism can be implemented by using **parallel computers,** i.e. a computer with many processors. Parallel computers require parallel algorithm, programming languages, compilers and operating system that support multitasking.
