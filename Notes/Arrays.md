An array is a type of [[Data Structure]].
An array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory locations.

For simplicity, we can think of an array as a fleet of stairs where on each step is placed a value (let’s say one of your friends). Here, you can identify the location of any of your friends by simply knowing the count of the step they are on.   
Remember: “Location of next index depends on the data type we use”.
