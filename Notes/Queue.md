A queue is defined as a linear [[data structure]] that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.

We define a queue to be a list in which all additions to the list are made at one end, and all deletions from the list are made at the other end.  The element which is first pushed into the order, the operation is first performed on that.

## **FIFO Principle of Queue:**

-   A Queue is like a line waiting to purchase tickets, where the first person in line is the first person served. (i.e. First come first serve).
-   Position of the entry in a queue ready to be served, that is, the first entry that will be removed from the queue, is called the **front** of the queue(sometimes, **head** of the queue), similarly, the position of the last entry in the queue, that is, the one most recently added, is called the **rear** (or the **tail**) of the queue. See the below figure.

Below is implementation of queue in C++

```cpp
// CPP program for array
// implementation of queue
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// A structure to represent a queue
class Queue {
public:
	int front, rear, size;
	unsigned capacity;
	int* array;
};

// function to create a queue
// of given capacity.
// It initializes size of queue as 0
Queue* createQueue(unsigned capacity)
{
	Queue* queue = new Queue();
	queue->capacity = capacity;
	queue->front = queue->size = 0;

	// This is important, see the enqueue
	queue->rear = capacity - 1;
	queue->array = new int[queue->capacity];
	return queue;
}

// Queue is full when size
// becomes equal to the capacity
int isFull(Queue* queue)
{
	return (queue->size == queue->capacity);
}

// Queue is empty when size is 0
int isEmpty(Queue* queue)
{
	return (queue->size == 0);
}

// Function to add an item to the queue.
// It changes rear and size
void enqueue(Queue* queue, int item)
{
	if (isFull(queue))
		return;
	queue->rear = (queue->rear + 1)
				% queue->capacity;
	queue->array[queue->rear] = item;
	queue->size = queue->size + 1;
	cout << item << " enqueued to queue\n";
}

// Function to remove an item from queue.
// It changes front and size
int dequeue(Queue* queue)
{
	if (isEmpty(queue))
		return INT_MIN;
	int item = queue->array[queue->front];
	queue->front = (queue->front + 1)
				% queue->capacity;
	queue->size = queue->size - 1;
	return item;
}

// Function to get front of queue
int front(Queue* queue)
{
	if (isEmpty(queue))
		return INT_MIN;
	return queue->array[queue->front];
}

// Function to get rear of queue
int rear(Queue* queue)
{
	if (isEmpty(queue))
		return INT_MIN;
	return queue->array[queue->rear];
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	Queue* queue = createQueue(1000);

	enqueue(queue, 10);
	enqueue(queue, 20);
	enqueue(queue, 30);
	enqueue(queue, 40);

	cout << dequeue(queue)
		<< " dequeued from queue\n";

	cout << "Front item is "
		<< front(queue) << endl;
	cout << "Rear item is "
		<< rear(queue) << endl;

	return 0;
}

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

### Auxiliary Space

O(N) where N is the size of the array for storing elements.
